									<h2>Content Aware Image Resizing</h2>
									<p>A discord bot that uses Computer Vision to resize an image by removing only the least noticeable pixels.</p>
									<p>Uses Discord.js and Node.js to build a Canvas context from an image sent by the user on Discord. This information is then passed to a C++ program on the server that uses Dynamic Programming to efficiently detect and selectively remove least noticeable pixels. The re-sized image is then provided to the user by the bot through a message attachment on discord.</p>

									<h2>Map building from LiDAR data</h2>
									<p>Uses a Kalman Filter Algorithm to process and transform point cloud data collected from a thirty-two beam LiDAR on a robot using Julia.</p>
									<p>Parsed robot pose and point cloud data to calculate Linear Affine Transformations needed to bring data into the World Frame in real time. Fused Data collected collected over multiple time periods with the robot&apos;s motion to gain full scene understanding and build a map. The gif here shows the map built over 5 seconds as the robot walked towards a staircase.</p>

									<h2>Dog Breed Recognition</h2>
									<p>Trained a Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) to identify 8 species of dogs: samoyed, poodle, saint bernard, dalmatian, chihuahua, husky, and yorkshire terrier.</p>
									<p>Preprocessed the images to make the underlying distribution of each image channel have mean and variance 0 and 1 respectively. Used Python PyTorch and TensorFlow to train a 6 layer CNN on about 9000 images of dogs labeled with their breeds. Correctly classified about 72% of test images, taking about 3 seconds to classify each individual image.</p>

										<h3>Study Group Facilitator</h3>
									</a>
									<p>Lead a two-hour weekly session working closely with a group of about fifteen students enrolled in Electricity and Magnetism - General Physics II (Physics 240) at the University of Michigan in a discussion of fundamental physics topics and course material. Prepare worksheets and Practice exams to refresh students' understanding of course content and help them prepare for exams.</p>

										<h3>Software Development Intern, Amazon</h3>
									</a>
									Developed a dynamic filtering feature on Amazon Seller Central Homepage, enhacing user engagement and content discoverability for millions of users worldwide. Designed web components in React and Stencil on homepage frontend to enable filtering and ensured seamless integration
									of these components with existing infrastructure, preserving usage metrics and user experience continuity.

										<h3>IEEE-HKN</h3>
									</a>
									<p>HKN is an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Honor Society affiliated with IEEE dedicated to leadership, scholarship and service. I hold weekly drop-in tutoring sessions to support first and second year students taking introductory EECS courses such as Introduction to Programming (ENGR 101), Data Structures and Algorithms (EECS 280/281) and Discrete Mathematics (EECS 203).</p>

										<span class="icon solid major fa-external-link-alt"></span>
										<h3>Machine Learning: EECS 445</h3>
									</a>
									<p>This course laid the foundation of key Machine Learning topics including the Perceptron algorithms, clustering (k-means, spectral and heirarchical clustering), Neural Networks, Markov Models, regression, classification, kernel methods, regularization, neural networks, graphical models, and unsupervised learning.</p>

										<h3>Web Development: EECS 485</h3>
									</a>
									<p>A holistic course of modern web systems and technologies, covering front end and back end. Developed various full stack applications throughout the course of the project such as a clone of Instagram as well as a mini search engine using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python (Flask), and SQL. Also utilized assymetric encryption and distributed systems to improve web security and scalability.</p>

										<span class="icon solid major fa-external-link-alt"></span>
										<h3>Data Structure and Algorithms: EECS 281</h3>
									</a>
									<p>Introduced data structures, algorithms, and techniques to solve common programming problems. Through this course, I built a log manager, a path finding system for a robot as well as a brute force and heuristic approach to solve the Travelling Salesperson Problem. Each of these projects required analyzing runtime and memory of various correct solutions in terms of Big-O notation to create an efficient solution that met the constraints.</p>
